# Thomas' Repository

This is the repository of Thomas, which currently includes two projects I am working on.

# Routenplanner
Currently includes a routeplanner as a command line application, where edges and nodes can be added and deleted.
The shortest path can be then calculated. Commands include ADD, DEL, LISTNODES, LISTEDGES, ROUTE (shortest route between two nodes), SAVE and LOAD

# Soccer World Cup Bets
Make guesses how games will end, and also save the result of games. User can be created and deleted so each user can make his own guesses.
