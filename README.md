# Scorpiadin's Repository

This is the repository of Scorpiadin, which currently includes two projects I am working on.

# Routeplaner
Currently includes a routeplanner as a command line application, where edges and nodes can be added and deleted.
The shortest path can be then calculated.

# WM-Soccerguess
Make guesses how games will end, and also save the result of games.
